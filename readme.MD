Hello fellow developers!
I want to introduce with you this beginners project "Weather App"
This application is made using open weather, open source api.
I want you to contribute in this project and make it realtime application which will show the data without typing city name by getting your current location automatically.
You have restriction to use node js only. PHP projects will come soon.

Happy Coding!
